    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line an 8x8-inch
                square pan with enough parchment paper to have overhang on all sides.
            </li>
            <li>Cream together butter, 1/2 cup white sugar, and brown sugar in a 
                bowl with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Mix in egg 
                and vanilla until thoroughly combined. Add in flour, cream of 
                tartar, baking soda, salt, 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon, and nutmeg, and
                mix until a dough just begins to form. 
            </li>
            <li>Place dough into prepared pan. Using lightly floured hands, press
                dough firmly and evenly into the bottom of the pan.
            </li>
            <li>In a small bowl, mix together 1 tnsp white sugar and 1/2 tsp
                cinnamon. Sprinkle evenly over the dough.
            </li>
            <li>Place pan into the preheated over, and bake just until the dough 
                in the center of the pan feels barely set, 20 to 23 minutes. 
                Do not over bake.
            </li>
            <li>Allow cookies to cool in pan for 10 minutes before removing to a 
                wire rack to cool completely. Cut into 16 bars.
            </li>
        </ol>
