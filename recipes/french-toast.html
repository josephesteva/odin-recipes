    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>An easy breakfast or brunch recipe that can be served with your favorite
        toppings!
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 large croissants, halved horizontally, left out overnight</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>1/2 cup half-and-half</li>
            <li>1 tbsp white sugar</li>
            <li>2 tsps vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 pinch ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>2 tbsps unsalted butter</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C)</li>
            <li> Whisk eggs, half-and-half, sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, salt, and 
                nutmeg together in a shallow bowl. Dip each croissant into the 
                egg mixture, one at a time, flipping it and lightly pressing down
                until will coated.
            </li>
            <li>Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat; add four 
                croissant halves, cut side down. Fry until browned on both sides,
                turning once, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer to the oven to
                keep warm while you cook the remaining croissants.
            </li>
            <li>Serve warm with your favorite toppings.</li>
        </ol>

    <p>Note: It's important that the croissants are dry before dipping. An 
        alternative to leaving the croissants sit out overnight, you can place the
        sliced croissants on a baking sheet, and toast in the oven at 200 degrees F 
        (95 degrees C) until dry, 12 to 15 minutes.</p>
